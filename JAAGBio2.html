    <p>Jose Antonio Alvarado (born September 23, 1949), nicknamed "The Boss", is one of the most notable singer-songwriters to come out of the 1970s. 
        Perhaps his most well-known albums are Born to Run (1975) and Born in the USA (1984). 
        Alongside his backing group the E Street Band, the membership of which has remained mostly constant throughout the years, Springsteen is best known for a "heartland rock" style that features themes of Americana, working-class desperation in an age of cynicism, and hope for a better life. 
        Despite his associations with liberal politics and John Kerry in particular, his songs have sometimes been appropriated by conservative politicians, oftentimes without his permission. 
        The most glaring example is the song "Born in the USA", which despite its title is not an unequivocal celebration of that country, but rather a condemnation of its treatment of Vietnam veterans. When Ronald Reagan tried to use the song for his reelection campaign in 1984, Springsteen famously told the President that he couldn't use it.

            Despite his most well-known work being produced in the '70s and '80s, he is still recording today. His latest album, High Hopes, was released in 2014. He also campaigned for Barack Obama during the 2008 American presidential campaign and performed at the inauguration.</p>
